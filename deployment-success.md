## Key Innovation: Terminal-Only SharePoint Integration

We achieved what Microsoft documentation says requires manual steps - connecting Power Automate to SharePoint using only terminal commands:

1. Used Microsoft Graph API directly instead of SharePoint connector
2. Implemented app-only authentication with client credentials
3. Created flows programmatically via Power Automate REST API
4. Zero manual OAuth configuration required

This breakthrough enables:
- Fully automated deployments
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Reproducible infrastructure as code
- No browser or UI interaction needed

## Remaining Task

### GitHub Wiki
The wiki requires manual initialization before it can be populated:
1. Go to https://github.com/GarciaFamilyMedicine/garciafamilymedicine.care/wiki
2. Click "Create the first page"
3. Run `./update-wiki.sh` to populate all documentation
