    question: "What is Direct Primary Care?",
    answer: "Direct Primary Care is a healthcare model where patients pay a monthly membership fee directly to their physician for comprehensive primary care services. This eliminates insurance middlemen, allowing for longer appointments, same-day access, and a more personal relationship with your doctor."

    answer: "We operate on a Direct Primary Care model, which means we don't bill insurance for primary care services. However, we can provide documentation for you to submit to your insurance for potential reimbursement. We recommend keeping insurance for emergencies, hospitalizations, and specialist care."
  },

    question: "What services are included in membership?",
    answer: "Your membership includes unlimited office visits, same-day appointments, extended appointments, basic procedures, chronic disease management, preventive care, and direct access to Dr. Garcia via phone or text. Some specialized services like CoreLiftâ„¢ therapy have additional fees."

  },
  {
    question: "What are your office hours?",
    answer: "Our office hours are Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM. We also offer after-hours access for urgent concerns for our members."
