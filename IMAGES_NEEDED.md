- Abstract healthcare visualizations
- Professional quality maintaining consistency across the site

### Alternative Style Options:
1. **Minimalist Geometric**: clean lines, limited color palette, modern design aesthetic
2. **Organic Flow**: natural curves, biomimetic patterns, smooth gradients
3. **Tech Forward**: futuristic medical visualization, holographic elements
4. **Watercolor Blend**: soft color bleeds, artistic medical concept, fine art healthcare
