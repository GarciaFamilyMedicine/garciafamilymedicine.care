# HIPAA Compliance Analysis - Email Newsletter Collection

## Current Implementation Analysis

### What We're Collecting:
- **Email address**
- **Source** (which form/page)
- **Timestamp** (when submitted)
- **Status** (Active/Inactive)
- **IP Address** (captured by Power Automate)
- **Unsubscribe Token** (auto-generated)
- **Notes** (optional field)

### HIPAA Classification:
**Email addresses alone are NOT considered Protected Health Information (PHI)** unless combined with health information.

## HIPAA Compliance Status: ✅ COMPLIANT

### Why This Implementation is HIPAA Compliant:

1. **No PHI Collection**
   - We only collect email addresses
   - No health information is requested or stored
   - No patient identifiers beyond email

2. **Secure Transmission**
   - HTTPS encryption in transit
   - OAuth2 secured Power Automate
   - App-only authentication (no user credentials exposed)

3. **Secure Storage**
   - SharePoint (Microsoft 365) is HIPAA compliant
   - Data stays within organization's tenant
   - Access controls via Azure AD

4. **Audit Trail**
   - Power Automate logs all executions
   - SharePoint tracks modifications
   - Azure AD logs access

## Recommendations for Full HIPAA Compliance

### 1. Add Privacy Notice

- Honor opt-out requests promptly

### 3. Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
- ✅ Microsoft 365 offers BAA
- ✅ SharePoint covered under BAA
- ✅ Power Automate covered under BAA

### 4. Access Controls
- Limit SharePoint list access to authorized staff
- Use role-based permissions
- Regular access reviews

### 5. Data Retention Policy
- Define how long emails are kept
- Implement automatic deletion after X years
- Document retention policy

## Future Health Data Collection (IMPORTANT)

**ASSUMPTION: This system will be used to collect health questionnaire data in the future.**

When collecting PHI (Protected Health Information) with emails:

### Required Technical Safeguards:
1. **Encryption at Rest**
   - ✅ Already provided by SharePoint

2. **Access Controls**
   - Implement multi-factor authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Audit logging

3. **Transmission Security**
   - ✅ Already using HTTPS
   - ✅ OAuth2 authentication

4. **Data Integrity**
   - SharePoint versioning enabled
   - Backup and recovery procedures

### Required Administrative Safeguards:
1. Security officer designation
2. Workforce training
3. Access management procedures
4. Security incident procedures

### Required Physical Safeguards:
1. Facility access controls
2. Workstation security
3. Device and media controls
