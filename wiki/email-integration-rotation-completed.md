# Email Integration Rotation Completed

## Overview
The email integration credentials have been successfully rotated on 2025-01-24 following the security incident where sensitive IDs were exposed in documentation.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Security Documentation Updated
- Removed all hardcoded IDs from wiki files
- Replaced sensitive values with placeholders
- Created comprehensive rotation guide

### 2. New Resources Created
- **App Registration**: New Azure AD app created with fresh credentials
- **Client Secret**: Generated with 2-year expiration (expires 2027)
- **Power Automate Flow**: New flow deployed with app-only authentication
- **Webhook URL**: New secure webhook endpoint configured

### 3. Configuration Updated
- Local `.env.local` file updated
- Azure Static Web Apps configuration updated
- All sensitive IDs removed from version control

## Next Steps

### Required Actions
1. **Update GitHub Secrets**
   - Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_NEWSLETTER_WEBHOOK_URL` with the new webhook URL from .env.local

2. **Delete Old Resources**
   - Remove the old compromised app registration from Azure AD
   - Delete the old Power Automate flow

3. **Monitor Integration**
   - Check Power Automate run history for successful submissions
   - Verify emails are being saved to SharePoint

### Security Best Practices Going Forward
- Never commit actual IDs or secrets to documentation
- Always use placeholder values in wiki/docs
- Store sensitive values only in environment variables
- Rotate credentials regularly (every 6-12 months)

## Technical Notes

### Known Issues
- SharePoint "Email" column uses internal name "LinkTitle"
- This is a legacy issue from the original list configuration
- Emails are still saved successfully in the Title field

### Verification
To verify the integration is working:
1. Test email signup on the website
2. Check Power Automate flow runs
3. Verify new entries in SharePoint list
